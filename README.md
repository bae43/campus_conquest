Current Developement (v.1.2):
Adding Websockets support for fast and efficient sending of data. Polling in previous versions stalled the game every few seconds.

All code from current version (v.1.2) is by me, Bryce Evans, unless noted in the file header.
In previous versions 1.0 and 1.1, Qiming Fang (fanghai) helped with the SQL database for multiplayer support.
